            /* Exercise 1: Design a database connectionTo access a database, we need to open a 
             * connection to it first and close it once our job is done. Connecting to a database 
             * depends on the type of the target database and the database management system (DBMS). 
             * For example, connecting to a SQL Server database is different from connecting to an 
             * Oracle database. But both these connections have a few things in common: 
             * 
             * •They have a connection string 
             * •They can be opened
             * •They can be closed
             * •They may have a timeout attribute (so if the connection could not be opened within the timeout, 
             * an exception will be thrown).
             * 
             * Your job is to represent these commonalities in a base class called DbConnection. 
             * This class should have two properties: ConnectionString : stringTimeout : TimeSpanA 
             * 
             * DbConnection will not be in a valid state if it doesn’t have a connection string. 
             * So you need to pass a connection string in the constructor of this class. 
             * Also, take into account the scenarios where null or an empty string is sent as the connection string. 
             * Make sure to throw an exception to guarantee that your class will always be in a valid state.
             * Our DbConnection should also have two methods for opening and closing a connection. 
             * We don’t know how to open or close a connection in a DbConnection and this should be left to the classes that derive from DbConnection. 
             * These classes (eg SqlConnection or OracleConnection) will provide the actual implementation. 
             * So you need to declare these methods as abstract.
             * Derive two classes SqlConnection and OracleConnection from DbConnection and provide a simple implementation of opening and closing connections using Console.WriteLine(). 
             * In the real-world, SQL Server provides an API for opening or closing a connection to a database. 
             * But for this exercise, we don’t need to worry about it.
